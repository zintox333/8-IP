This is what the Main menu should loook like

How to Use this tool explained for dummys : 

1. TARGET SERVER IP
You type in a website or server name, and it tells you the IP address of that server. Think of it like looking up someone’s street address so you know where to send mail.

2. IP LOOKUP
You give it an IP address, and it tells you info about it—like the city, country, ISP, maybe even who owns it. It’s basically “Who does this IP belong to?”

3. PUBLIC IP
This shows your own internet-facing IP address—the one websites see when you connect to them. Like your home’s mailing address but for the internet.

4. DOMAIN NAME
You can enter a website name and see the domain info—like who registered it, expiration date, and registrar. Kind of like checking the ownership of a car or house.

5. PRIVATE IP
This shows your local network IP—your computer’s “house number” inside your Wi-Fi network. Not visible to the whole internet, just inside your home or office network.

6. VALIDITY
This checks if an IP or domain is valid and reachable. Like calling a phone number to see if it’s active before you dial.

7. MAC ADDRESS
Shows the unique hardware ID of your network adapter. Think of it as the fingerprint of your network card.

0. Exit
Quit the program.

The Tool is pretty simple to use and Understand
